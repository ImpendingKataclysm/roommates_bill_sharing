# roommates_bill_sharing
Helps users organize and manage shared bill payments by determining how much 
each roommate owes based on how long they were staying at home during the bill
period, enabling some roommates to pay less if they were staying away from home
and thereby consuming less power and fewer utilities during the billing period.


Users enter the billing period dates, the amount owing for the billing period,
the names of each roommate and the dates during which each person was staying 
there, and the program generates a PDF detailing how much each person owes for 
the period.
